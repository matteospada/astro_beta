# How to configure Astro

To start using Astro you need two things:

* At least one app published in the App Store
* An Apple Search Ads account (**No payment information needed**)

Astro works using the data from Apple Search Ads (**ASA**), to start using Astro you have to configure an account in ASA Advance and create a new campaign, you can find a complete guide on creating the account at [this link](https://searchads.apple.com/help/get-started/0004-set-up-an-account#:~:text=Get%20started%20from%20the%20Apple,and%20date%2Ftime%20format%20preference), you don't need to insert a payment method to use Astro.

If you don't have an ASA account and your Country is not present in the list of available countries you can insert United States.

After creating the account, you need to create a new campaign group. You can do this by simply clicking on Start now on [this page](https://searchads.apple.com/advanced#), after logging in you must select your name in the upper left corner and click on create new campaigns group. You can name the new group Astro.

You are now ready to start using Astro. To configure ASA in Astro, simply click on the traffic light button (bottom right), log in with your Apple ID and click on the new campaign group just created.

If everything worked fine, you will see an alert telling you that ASA is configured correctly.
